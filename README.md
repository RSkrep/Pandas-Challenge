# Pandas-Challenge
For this challenge we were given a data set on students grades and the school they attend. With this dataset we needed to break down the data into categories revolving around school types, school names, school student sizes, school budgets, school budgets per student, average student grades for mathematics and reading and the percent average of students who pass math and reading. Then analyze each of these categories to gain the most information about which schools were succeeding the most, compared to which were succeeding the least, with regards to their students academic performance. Once analyzed we needed to provide the majoring factors that displayed their disparities and how they are can be scene when looking at the organized data.

Completion process I would first attempt to find each of these value using my memory, then i would lookinto the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when i was lost. After doing these steps i would consult ChatGPT to find out where i went wrong and would use its assitance to correct the code as well as explain its proccess to me so i could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid.
